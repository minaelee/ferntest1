## What's covered

There are two parts to this Quickstart.

In Part 1, you will:

- Create your Fern Docs site from a GitHub starter template
- Update its configuration files
- Generate your docs site and publish it to a subdomain on `docs.buildwithfern.com`

In Part 2, you will:

- Obtain a Fern Token and add it to your Fern Docs GitHub repository's secrets
- Learn how to edit your API reference
- Use Fern's CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically:
  - check for problems
  - preview the site
  - publish the site

## Part 1: Create and publish your starter site

### Steps

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create a new GitHub repository from our starter template

1. Log into GitHub and open our [Docs Starter with Fern Definition](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-fern-definition) GitHub repository.
2. From this repository, click the **Use this template** button.
3. Choose the option to **create a new repository**. Name it `fern-docs`, or another name if you prefer.

### Step 2: Clone and open the repository in your preferred code editor

Clone your newly created repository locally and open it in your favorite code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The `fern/` folder in your repository contains these files and folders:

<CodeBlock title='fern/'>
```yml
├─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml
  ├─ pet.yml
  ├─ store.yml
  └─ user.yml
├─ docs/
  ├─ assets/
  └─ pages/
    ├─ concepts.mdx
    ├─ sdks.mdx
    └─ welcome.mdx
├─ docs.yml
└─ fern.config.json
```
</CodeBlock>

The `definition/` folder contains the Fern Definition for a sample API called Swagger Petstore. Fern uses the Fern Definition to generate the API Reference section of your docs site.

The files inside the `pages/` folder are used to generate other documentation pages, such as a Welcome page. The `docs.yml` file sets up site navigation and custom styles. 

### Step 3: Customize organization name and url

In the repository that you cloned locally, open the `fern.config.json` file, which looks like this:

```json
{
  "organization": "Petstore",
  "version": "0.x.x"
}
```

Replace `"Petstore"` with your own organization name within the quotes. Spaces are permitted. Leave the `version` number unchanged. 

Open the `docs.yml` file and locate the `url`, which looks like this:

```yml
instances:
  - url: petstore-ferndef.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

Replace `petstore-ferndef` with your own organization's name. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces, and leave the rest of the URL (`.docs.buildwithfern.com`) unchanged. 

### Step 4: Install the Fern CLI tool

Install the Fern CLI tool globally by running:

```shell
npm install -g fern-api
```

<Note>
The above CLI command is a global command that you can run from any location. The `fern` commands in the following steps must be run from within your repository.
</Note>

### Step 5: Generate your documentation

Run the following command:

```shell
fern generate --docs
```

When prompted, log into and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, Fern displays the production URL where the documentation is published. For example:

```shell
┌─
│ ✓  petstore-ferndef.docs.buildwithfern.com
└─
```

Instead of `petstore-ferndef`, you should see the organization name that you added to `docs.yml` earlier. Visit the link to view your starter site.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have now created and published your starter site. Next, you'll learn how to use a CI/CD pipeline to update your site.

## Part 2: Edit the site and automate publishing updates

<Steps>

### Step 1: Obtain a Fern token

From within your local `fern/` repository, run:

<CodeBlock title='Fern CLI'>
```shell 
fern token 
```
</CodeBlock>

The output from this command contains a string called a Fern Token that begins with `fern_`. It is an access token unique to the GitHub account you used to login to the Fern CLI. Copy your token to a secure location. 

### Step 2: Add your Fern token to your remote repository

In the GitHub repository you created from our `docs-starter-fern-definition` template in Part 1, which you used to clone your local Fern Docs repository, open its Settings. The Settings tab is the rightmost tab at the top of the repository webpage.

In the Security section of the left sidebar of the Settings tab, click **Secrets and variables**, then **Actions**.

TODO: SCREENSHOT of the sidebar with Actions showing 

Under **Repository Secrets**, click **New repository secret**.

For the **Name** of the secret, enter `FERN_TOKEN`.

In the **Secret** field, paste in the Fern token that you created in Step 1. 

TODO: SCREENSHOT of the name/secrets page

Finally, click **Add secret**.

### Step 3: Push the changes from Part 1 to GitHub

In Part 1, you generated and published your Fern Docs site manually using `fern generate --docs`. In practice, we recommend using Fern's CI/CD pipeline through [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) instead.

The repository you cloned has a `.github/workflows/` folder at its root, the `fern-docs/` folder. This folder contains three GitHub Actions files that affect this repository:

<CodeBlock title='fern-docs/'>
```yml
├─  .github/workflows/
  ├─ check.yml
  ├─ preview-docs.yml
  └─ publish-docs.yml
├─ fern/
└─ README.md
```
</CodeBlock>

- The `check.yml` workflow runs `fern check` whenever a pull request is created or updates are pushed to the `main` branch. `fern check` validates your API definition and documentation and outputs warnings and errors.
- The `preview-docs.yml` workflow runs `fern generate --docs --preview` whenever a pull request (PR) is created. It generates a preview site containing the updates in the PR and displays the preview URL in the PR. See [Pull request previews](/fern-docs/previews) for more information. 
- The `publish-docs.yml` workflow runs `fern generate --docs` whenever updates are pushed to the `main` branch. This is the same Fern CLI command you used to publish your starter site in [Step 5](#step-5-generate-your-documentation) of Part 1. 

You can use these GitHub Actions to publish updates to your docs site in two ways:
1. You can push directly to the main branch. The `check` and `publish-docs` workflows validate your changes and update your site.
2. You can create and push a new branch, then submit a PR for the new branch. The `check` and `preview-docs` workflows validate your changes and create a preview site. If everything looks good, you or another approver can merge the PR, which results in a push to the `main` branch. This triggers the `publish-docs` workflow, which updates your site. 

Let's try approach #1. In Part 1, you made changes to `docs.yml` and `fern.config.json` on the `main` branch. Commit and push those changes now with the following command:

<CodeBlock title="CLI">
```shell 
git add . && git commit -m "update site config" && git push
```
</CodeBlock>

This command pushes your updates directly to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

On the webpage for that repository, click the **Actions** tab across the top. 

TODO: Details on what happens then.

### Step 4: Create a new git branch for updates

In the previous step, you pushed updates that were made to the main branch. A common scenario is to make updates to a separate branch, push that branch to the remote repository, then submit a pull request for that branch to be merged. Let's walk through this scenario. 

To begin, create and switch to a new git branch named `update-docs-example`:
<CodeBlock title="CLI">
```shell 
git switch -c update-docs-example
```
</CodeBlock>

### Step 5: Update the Fern Definition

Open the `definition/pet.yml` file. 
TBD: Describe what to change.

### Step 6: Push the updated branch

Run the following CLI command:
<CodeBlock title="CLI">
```shell 
git add . && git commit -m 'update pets.yml' && git push -u origin update-docs-example
```
</CodeBlock>

TBD: Describe what to look for in the repo actions page


</Steps>

## What's next?


### Customize your documentation

You must run `fern generate --docs` after any modifications to re-generate and publish your documentation site.

To preview updates to your documentation before publishing changes, run `fern generate --docs --preview`.

To modify the API Reference:

- Update or replace the Fern Definition files in the `definition/` folder. See our documentation on [how to define your API with Fern Definition](/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/overview).

To modify the other docs pages or add new pages:

- Update the files located in the `docs/pages/` folder, such as `welcome.mdx`. See our documentation on [how to write content with Markdown and MDX](/fern-docs/content/write-markdown).

To configure site navigation, styles, and see other configuration options:

- See [Fern Docs Configuration Overview](/fern-docs/config/overview).

To learn about Fern's built-in component library you can use in Markdown:

- See the [Component Library](/fern-docs/content/components/).

### Set up a custom domain, subdomain, or subpath

If you wish to use a custom domain (such as `https://example.com`), subdomain (such as `https://docs.example.com`), or subpath (such as `https://example.docs.buildwithfern.com/learn`), visit the [Custom domain](/fern-docs/config/branding/custom-domain) page. 


Good luck creating beautiful and functional documentation! 🌿
